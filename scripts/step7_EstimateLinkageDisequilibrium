# Linkage Disequilibrium
I think I should estimate LD per collection site and chromosome for both the modern and ancient individuals. 

Hypothesis:

- The modern samples should display long-range LD on chrom 8, 12, and 15 (as seen with RAdseq paper)
- the ancient samples...I guess if LD is still concentrated on those chromosomes, then that means that the putative inversions are quite old. I wonder what we will find, this is so exciting!!
